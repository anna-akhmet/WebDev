							<h2>Second-Skin Tops</h2>
							<p>Second-skin tops went viral this year when Adele and Beyonce both wore Marine Serre's cult moon-print fitted top. These body-skimming jersey and knitted tops were seen at the likes of Miu Miu and Jil Sander, and were either worn tucked into high-waistlines or used as a base layering piece. This was a key element in Raf Simons' Prada collection, as tight hole-strewn rollnecks were layered under cropped cardigans.
							<br><br>
							Mesh tops have been selling like hotcakes over at stores like COS and Weekday, but there are some stylish people ready to take on mesh leggings and trousers as well, and why not?
							<br><br>
							With mesh tops we're finding that the best ones are printed or have surface detailing to make them feel extra special.
							<br><br>
							The perfect partner to jeans but also just as fun with something jazzy, your mesh top is more versatile than you might thinkâ€¦

							<h2>Feel-Good Prints</h2>
							<p>Rainbow stripes became the unofficial motif for 2020, and a symbol of hope and optimism, and so it's not surprising that this was a reference for designers for SS21. Tie-dye isn't just a lockdown hobby, as proved by the swirly prints at Gabriella Hearst, while Versace and Christopher John Rogers played with mood-boosting stripes.
							<br><br>
							The subtle tie-dye trend has really found its natural home in super-versatile mesh tops. All of our team is hooked, especially editor Emma Spedding.
							<br><br>
							You will find acidic tie-dye options on the runways and in stores this coming summer, but we're feeling muted tones for easier day-to-day wear.

							<h2>Light, Sheer Fabrics</h2>
							<p>There was also a feeling of fluidity in many of the collections, with light, sheer fabrics that floated off the body. At Acne and Jil Sander these sheer pieces were layered beautifully, and all came in a soft and romantic colour palette.</p>
